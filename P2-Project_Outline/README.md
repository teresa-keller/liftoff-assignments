## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I am making an Ebay Organizer. The app will be helpful for people who sell a lot on Ebay.  The user will be able to track items they are currently selling, items that have already sold, and items they are planning to list for sale. It will also allow the user to keep track of their Ebay related expenses, such as listing fees, shipping, and taxes. 

I came up with the idea because my son is unable to work during the pandemic, so he has been selling old toys on Ebay to make money. I thought it would be nice for him to have a convenient way to digitally keep track of everything related to his sales.

### Features

User login: Users will be able to register and login to their Ebay Organizer. Only the user will be able to access their information about their Ebay transactions.

Items: Users will be able to enter information about each item they want to list. Such as the name, description, condition, asking price, make an offer price, etc.

Photo upload: Users will be able to upload photos of the items they are listing.

Status update: Users will be able to update the status of the items from wanting to sell, to selling, to sold.

Important seller information: Users will have a place to store all of the important information related to the sale of an item. This will include the final selling price, the buyers information, tracking details, etc.

Similar item search: Users will be able to search Ebay for items similar to what they are going to list, to get an idea of how much people are willing to pay for the item.

### Technologies

I would like to use Java and JavaScript to build my app. I will work in IntelliJ using SpringBoot, MySQL, Hibernate, and Thymeleaf templates since I have used these before and I already have a feel for them. I will probably include Bootstrap for aesthetic appeal.

### What I'll Have to Learn

I'll have to learn how to link to Ebay's API so users can search Ebay from the app and obtain important selling information.
